In an increasingly automated world, the need for efficient and reliable vehicle identification systems has become paramount.
License plate detection and recognition (LPDR) technology plays a crucial role in various applications, from traffic management and law enforcement to parking solutions and toll collection.
This project aims to develop a robust LPDR system that accurately detects and recognizes license plates in real time, leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning techniques.
